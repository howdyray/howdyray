1. **My professional mantra: perfection should never be the enemy of progress** (paraphrasing Winston Churchill). My view of success is constantly learning. We'll probably miss the mark sometimes, but we iterate and learn together.

2. **My personal mantra: improvement is an everyday ritual.** It is important to not get too attached to anything one thing, feeling, etc. The world around us is constantly changing and approaching life with curiosity expands my perspective for continuous growth.

3. **I am a macro-manager.** My job is to set your mission in a clear and compelling way, empower you to do great work, and remove any blockers that get in your way. If you need clarification, feedback, or support, you know where to find me. 😉 

4. **I value honesty and vulnerability.** At the end of the day, we all bring our own stories and baggage with us every day. I find it refreshing when people admit what they don't know, ask for help, and bring their full selves to work. I try my best to model this behavior with how I show up every day.

5. **I prefer brief, crisp, clear communications.** This means short meetings, decks that are 10 slides or less, more pictures than words, Slack rather than email, etc. If you feel something is better to discuss with me in person, don’t hesitate to ping me with what you’d like to talk about. 

6. **I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building respect in a team.** Working as a team means trusting your team to ask questions, assuming positive intent, and pushing each other out of our comfort zones.

7. **I deputize people and trust their judgment.** You gain my trust by building credibility. It’s a mixture of doing what you say you will, delivering quality on time, holding yourself accountable, and pushing to become better. The quickest way to lose that trust is to be dishonest, opaque, or lead with your agenda. I always put the team first.

8. **I do my best work in the morning.** My brain feels the freshest after a few cups of coffee. ☕ I prefer to have meaty topics or things to review during those hours before I hit the inevitable afternoon Zoom fatigue. 😵‍💫 


9. **I enjoy my work, but I need time to reenergize.** In full transparency, I've experienced some serious burnout in my career. I'm still working on finding what balance and boundaries mean for me. I've set my work hours and calendar to be public. I know things come up, but please respect those when possible. 💖


10. **If we aren’t having fun then what is the point?** I love sharing memes, talking about trashy TV, hearing about people's hobbies, terrible photoshop jobs, etc. As we work we must find those moments of levity.
